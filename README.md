# Online-Attendance-System

I developed this system using HTML and CSS. For database I used PHPMyAdmin, and connected HTMl files to database using PHP files.
This system gives basic UI to 3 types of user 
1.Teacher : 
  Who can Add ,edit,delete record from database of attendance
  And also can view Attendance by date or class name or roll no
  Teacher can produce report of Attendance
2. Student:
  Who can view it's own attendance by using roll no , can view report of attendance.
3. Parent:
  Who can view their child's attendance by using roll no , can view report of attendance.
  
  
Future Scope:
1. Send SMS to parents about attendance of their childern on week basis.
